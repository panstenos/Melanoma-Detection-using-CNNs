## Data Collection 
Since I am working at a Colab notebook I uploaded the zip folder of the data on my google drive and then unziped the folder using the following commands:
```python
# mount drive to colab
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# unzip the data
%cd '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Melanoma Cancer Detection'
!unzip data.zip
```

## Modelling
I explored 3 models. A custom CNN, AlexNet and InceptionV3. All models had an input shape of (224, 224, 3). I also defined a callback to terminate training when the training accuracy exceeded 99.0%.
```python
class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
    if(logs.get('accuracy')>0.99):
      print("\nReached 99.0% accuracy -> Terminating Training")
      self.model.stop_training = True
```
you call this function when you fit the model like so:
```python
history = model.fit(..., callbacks=[callbacks])
```

## Model Performance Comparison

For all training, RMSprop with a learning rate of 0.001 was used.

### Preprocessing A:

I initially performed multiple augmentations to the training images:
```python
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255.0,
                                   rotation_range=40,
                                   width_shift_range=0.1,
                                   height_shift_range=0.1,
                                   shear_range=0.05,
                                   zoom_range=0.05,
                                   horizontal_flip=True,
                                   fill_mode='nearest')

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(directory=train_dir, batch_size=20, class_mode='binary', target_size=(224,224))
```
For the test dataset:
```python
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255.0)

test_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(directory=test_dir, batch_size=20, class_mode='binary', target_size=(224,224))
```

Fitting the models:
```python
history = model.fit(train_generator, steps_per_epoch=25, epochs=100, verbose=1, validation_data=test_generator, validation_steps=5, callbacks=[callbacks])
```

| Model          | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Time per Epoch |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Custom CNN     | 0.8780         | 0.8700        |   9s           |
| AlexNet        | 0.8640         | 0.8600        |   9s           |
| InceptionV3    | 0.8880         | 0.9300        |  11s           |

AlexNet training history (original)

As you can see from the figure above, the training and the validation accuracy excibited some singificant fluctuations. This was a result from running only 25 training steps and 5 validation steps. To overcome this problem, in Preprocessing B, I doubled the number of both steps. These adjustments proved very effective as the fluctuationd were reduced to about Â±4%. Making that change  while keeping the augmentations resulted in the following training history for the AlexNet model:

### Preprocessing B:

For the second preprocessing, I did not perform any additional augmentations to the training dataset:
```python
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255.0)

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(directory=train_dir, batch_size=50, class_mode='binary', target_size=(224,224))
```
For the test dataset:
```python
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255.0)

test_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(directory=test_dir, batch_size=50, class_mode='binary', target_size=(224,224))
```

Fitting the models:
```python
history = model.fit(train_generator, steps_per_epoch=50, epochs=50, verbose=1, validation_data=test_generator, validation_steps=10, callbacks=[callbacks])
```

| Model          | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Time per Epoch |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Custom CNN     | 0.8844         | 0.8920        |   14s          |
| AlexNet        | 0.8658         | 0.8560        |   14s          |
| InceptionV3    | 0.9920         | 0.9260        |   15s          |

InceptionV3 training history: 

![image](https://github.com/panstenos/Melanoma-Detection-using-CNNs/assets/112823396/1841ccab-1896-4c0d-a0d9-bdf54e4ebeb4)

We can see that there is some clear overfitting of the model as the training accuracy approaches 100% while the test accuracy fluctuates around 92%. The dense layers of this network consist of a 10% dropout layer. Removing the dropout layer, we get slighly better results. Also the model reached 99.9% accuracy on the 43rd epoch - 6 epochs faster.

InceptionV3v3 training history:

| Model          | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Time per Epoch |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| InceptionV3    | 0.9920         | 0.9260        |   15s          |
| InceptionV3v3  | 0.9916         | 0.9384        |   21s          |
